# RISC-V Assembler Experiments

Included here are experiments in RISC-V assembler, either based on the book
*RISC-V Assembler Language* by Anthony J. Dos Reis and using the `rv` tool
(these end in .a), or the full GNU GCC RISC-V toolset with the Spike emulator
(these end in .s).

Obviously you'd have to be competely nuts to use any of this for your own stuff,
because this is part of me learning RISC-V and all very, very experimental. If
you do, note these are provided as is, with no guaranty, and I take no
responsibility for anything that happens. 

This code is placed in the public domain unless otherwise noted.
