Included here are experiments in RISC-V assembler, based on the book *RISC-V
Assembler Language* by Anthony J. Dos Reis and using the `rv` tool included.
Note that this tool as certain known limitations, such as no support for the compressed
instruction set (RV32C). 

Obviously you'd have to be competely nuts to use any of this for your own stuff,
because this is part of me learning RISC-V and all is experimental. If you do,
note these are provided as is, with no guaranty, and I take no responsibility
for anything that happens. 

This code is placed in the public domain unless otherwise noted.
