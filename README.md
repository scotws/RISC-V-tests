Included here are experiments in RISC-V assembler, based on the book *RISC-V
Assembler Language* by Anthony J. Dos Reis and using the `rv` tool included.

Obviously you'd have to be nuts to use any of this for your own stuff, because
this is part of me learning RISC-V and all is experimental. If you do, note
these are provided as is, with no guaranty, and I take no responsibility for
anything that happens. 

This code is placed in the public domain unless otherwise noted.
