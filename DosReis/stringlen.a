# Accept a string and return its length.

.text
_start:
		# print string
		la t0, prompt
		sout t0

		# We put the string address in a0 because later this will
		# probably be passed as function. Also, we're not sure how 
		# sin stores the string in memory
		sin a0

		mv t0, a0	# Pointer to text
		li t1, 0	# Counter 
loop:
		lbu t2, 0(t0)
		beqz t2, done

		addi t1, t1, 1
		addi t0, t0, 1
		j loop

done:
		addi t1, t1, -1
		dout t1
		halt

.data
prompt:		.asciz "String please: "
